                            <p> The king of MMORPGs is undoubtedly <em> World of Warcraft </em>. It shook the video game market to its core when it released in <time> 2004 </time>, peaking at 12 million players in <time> 2010 </time>. The amount of content and player variety makes it among the leading MMORPGs and best games of all time. </p>
                            <p> In <em> World of Warcraft </em>, players can choose to fight for the Horde or Alliance factions. Pandarens (a race from the Mists of Pandaria expansion) have the advantage of being able to choose, while other races are locked to a particular faction. Engaging quests, a dynamic leveling system, tons of loot and gear, being able to make friends... all of this makes <em> World of Warcraft </em> the best and most enduring MMORPG ever made, period. </p>

                            <p> Unlike the <em> Elder Scrolls </em> RPG games that were developed by Bethesda Softworks, <em> Elder Scrolls Online </em>'s developer is ZeniMax Online Studios. Despite being a company who doesn't usually develop <em> Elder Scrolls games </em>, ZeniMax Online did an excellent job at creating one of the best MMORPGs of all time. </p>
                            <p> Amazingly, they kept the game true to the <em> Elder Scrolls </em> series without making it a basic, typical MMORPG. It is recommended to play this game on PC, but the console versions are also excellent. Playing through dungeons was repetitive at launch, but an abundance of new content makes <em> Elder Scrolls Online </em> excel as an MMORPG. </p>

                            <p> <em> Final Fantasy XIV </em> isn't your typical <em> Final Fantasy </em> game. As a world-renowned role-playing game series, the transition to becoming an MMORPG was more difficult than Square Enix predicted. At launch, the game was a colossal failure. Later, Square Enix would re-release the game as <em> Final Fantasy XIV: Realm Reborn </em>. </p>
                            <p> After a long start, you dive into the action of <em> Final Fantasy XIV </em>, soon finding that completing quests in the <em> Final Fantasy XIV </em> realm is surprisingly fun. A wide variety of player classes and a large map are reasons to pick up <em> Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn today </em>. </p>

                            <p> As a game with the third-highest budget of any video game ever made, <em> Star Wars: The Old Republic </em> does a great job of keeping its RPG elements deep and enjoyable, and does it on a massive scale. Choosing to be a lightsaber-wielder or commando, players embark on a journey with a unique story for each character class. </p>
                            <p> No, it wasn't the sequel to <em> Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords </em> that people had hoped for, but it remains relevant in today's MMORPG world. <em> Star Wars: The Old Republic </em> is an excellent MMORPG that does an excellent job of telling an engaging <em> Star Wars </em> story. </p>

                            <p> For a free-to-play MMORPG that released all the way back in <time> 2001 </time>, <em> Runescape </em> has somehow managed to remain popular all these years. <em> Runescape </em> still has at least 50,000 players playing the game at any given time. In this title, players perform typical MMORPG tasks such as fishing, mining, blacksmithing, and battling with enemies. The PVP area in the wilderness is a true test of a player's <em> Runescape </em> prowess. </p>
                            <p> A new version of <em> Runescape </em> known as "<em> Runescape 3 </em>" released in 2013. Though there are new versions, <em> Old School Runescape </em> remains as the most popular version. Graphically, Old School Runescape is not very impressive, but the gameplay is fun, and that's what has made the difference. </p>

                            <p> Quite a few developers have attempted to create enjoyable outer-space-themed MMORPGs. Where most games have failed, <em> EVE Online </em> seems to work. The combat of the game may not be as good as <em> Star Wars Galaxies </em>, a <time> 2003 </time> outer space MMORPG (now sans servers), but it has much more content to keep players engaged. </p>

                            <p> Instead of being a typical questing MMORPG, <em> Guild Wars 2 </em> revolves around an event-based system, which allows players to fight with their guild. The concept of guilds is not unique to MMOs, but it seems like <em> Guild Wars 2 </em> got the formula correct the first time. </p>
                            <p> As a result of the game's success, expansions were made to supplement the base game's content. As a game released on <time datetime="2012-08-28"> August 28, 2012 </time> that doesn't require subscription fees, there are many reasons to jump into <em> Guild Wars 2 </em>. </p>

                            <p> After shifting to a free-to-play model, <em> Lord of the Rings Online: Shadows of Angmar </em> surged in popularity; its number of players has come down since then. Set in J.R.R Tolkien's Middle-earth, <em> Lord of the Rings Online </em> is much as you'd expect—it's a traditional MMORPG with a <em> Lord of the Rings </em> theme. </p>
                            <p> It's a game that encourages exploration, because of its discovery-friendly map. Chances are, if you enjoyed <em> Star Wars: The Old Republic </em> and are a fan of <em> Lord of the Rings </em>, you'll like this game. Much of <em> Lord of the Rings Online </em> alludes to the movies and books, which is a huge draw for fans of the series. </p>

                            <p> As you might expect, <em> Rift </em> is a typical MMORPG that is similar to <em> World of Warcraft </em>. Like <em> <abbr title="World of Warcraft"> WOW </abbr> </em>, Rift used a subscription service, then later integrated a free-to-play option with reduced features. </p>
                            <p> One might wonder why people would play <em> Rift </em> when they could play <em> <abbr title="World of Warcraft"> WOW </abbr> </em>. Yes, <em> Rift </em> did little to distinguish itself from the genre titan, yet some players prefer <em> Rift </em>'s intensity and wide selection of skills that give the game more depth. It's possible for people to like both <em> World of Warcraft </em> and <em> Rift </em>; both are excellent games. </p>

                            <p> <em> EverQuest </em> is one of the earliest MMORPGs that is still played by a large number of people. The game changed to a free-to-play model back in <time datetime="2012"> 2012 </time>, but players complained that the free-to-play option limited players to a small fraction of the game's content. </p>
                            <p> The game of <em> EverQuest </em> is one of the most influential MMORPGs of all time. Titles like <em> World of Warcraft </em> might have been different if not for the influence of <em> Everquest </em>. Played in the first-person, <em> Everquest </em> provided an immersive experience that made stealth-based and hands-on combat enjoyable. </p>
