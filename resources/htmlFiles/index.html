                    <h2> Definition </h2>

                    <p> <b> Massively multiplayer online role-playing games </b> (MMORPGs) are a combination of <b> role-playing video games </b> and massively multiplayer online games in which a very large number of players interact with one another within a virtual world. </p>
                    <p> As in all role-playing games or <b> RPGs </b>, the player assumes the role of a character (often in a fantasy world or science-fiction world) and takes control over many of that character's actions. MMORPGs are distinguished from single-player or small multi-player online RPGs by the number of players able to interact together, and by the game's persistent world (usually hosted by the game's publisher), which continues to exist and evolve while the player is offline and away from the game. </p>

                    <h2> Motivation </h2>

                    <p> I made the choice to create this website so I people that are into games could get an overview of the existing MMORPGs. This way i intend to get gamers' attention into MMORPGs since these kind of games were very popular when I was little and I don't like the idea of them getting lesser and lesser attention. Using this website I hope to bring back as many gamers as possible in the world of MMOS. </p>

                <section class="endMargin" id="History">

                    <h2> History </h2>

                    <p> MMORPG is a term coined by <b> Richard Garriott </b> to refer to massive multiplayer online role-playing games and their social communities. Previous to this and related coinages, these games were generally called <b> graphical MUDs </b>; the history of MMORPGs traces back directly through the MUD genre. Through this connection, MMORPGs can be seen to have roots in the earliest multi-user games such as <em> Mazewar </em> (<time datetime="1974"> 1974 </time>) and <em> MUD1 </em> (<time datetime="1978"> 1978 </time>). <time datetime="1985"> 1985 </time> saw the release of a roguelike (pseudo-graphical) MUD called <em> Island of Kesmai </em> on CompuServe and Lucasfilm's graphical MUD Habitat. The first fully graphical multi-user RPG was <em> Neverwinter Nights </em>, which was delivered through America Online in <time datetime="1991"> 1991 </time> and was personally championed by AOL President Steve Case. Other early proprietary graphical online RPGs include three on <em> The Sierra Network </em>: The Shadow of Yserbius in <time> 1992 </time>, <em> The Fates of Twinion </em> in <time> 1993 </time>, and <em> The Ruins of Cawdor </em> in <time> 1995 </time>. Another milestone came in <time> 1995 </time> as <b> NSFNET </b> restrictions were lifted, opening the Internet up for game developers, which allowed for the first truly "massively"-scoped titles. Finally, MMORPGs as defined today began with <em> Meridian 59 </em> in <time datetime="1996"> 1996 </time>, innovative both in its scope and in offering first-person 3D graphics, with <em> The Realm Online </em> appearing nearly simultaneously. <em> Ultima Online </em>, released in 1997, is often credited with first popularizing the genre, though more mainstream attention was garnered by <time datetime="1999"> 1999's </time> <em> EverQuest </em> and <em> Asheron's Call </em> in the West and <time datetime="1996"> 1996's </time> <em> Nexus: The Kingdom of the Winds </em> in South Korea. </p>
                    <p> The financial success of these early titles has ensured competition in the genre since that time. MMORPG titles now exist on consoles and in new settings. As of 2008, the market for MMORPGs has <em> Blizzard Entertainment's World of Warcraft </em> dominating as the largest MMORPG, alongside other titles such as <em> Final Fantasy XIV </em> and <em> Guild Wars 2 </em>, though an additional market exists for free-to-play MMORPGs, which are supported by advertising and purchases of in-game items. This free-to-play model is particularly common in South Korea such as <em> MapleStory </em>, <em> Rohan: Blood Feud </em>, and <em> Atlantica Online </em>. Also, there are some free-to-play games, such as <em> RuneScape </em> and <em> Tibia </em>, where the game is free, but one would have to pay monthly to play the game with more features. Guild Wars and its sequel avoid some degree of competition with other MMORPGs by only requiring the initial purchase of the game to play. </p>
